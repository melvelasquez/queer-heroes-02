        <h2>Bill Haskell</h2>
        <p id="first-p">Bill Haskell just had to get back to California. Although he was born in Long Beach, California, he grew up on the East Coast in the New York City metropolitan area.</p>

        <p>Haskell was finishing his graduate degree at New York University when his friend from high school, whom he used to sing with, June, asked him to visit her in Santa Barbara for the summer.</p>

        <p>“And I thought, wow, June's never asked me directly to do anything, so I'm gonna do it. So I moved,” Haskell recalled, “It's like going in the Wizard of Oz, from black and white into color. It's very different than the South Bronx.”</p>

        <p>After his visit, he went back to finish his degree at NYU, promptly packed up his car and moved back to Santa Barbara when he was 26.</p>

        <p>“I was there for four years. It's a beautiful place to live; it's a bit too moneyed for me. And there weren't many job opportunities,” said Haskell, “And all the gay people I knew moved to San Francisco, so I did the same thing.”</p>

        <p>He’s been in San Francisco since 1978, living in the same house for 42 years.</p>

        <p>“I actually thought San Francisco was ‘sin city’ and I wasn't sure that I was gonna be able to make a life here, but I did,” said Haskell.<p>

        <p>He started volunteering at the Pacific Center for Human Growth in Berkeley, the oldest LGBTQ+ center in the Bay Area that offers various mental health services and support. Folks from all over the country, mostly afraid and mostly closeted, would call in wanting advice on how to move to San Francisco, and Haskell would be one of the phone volunteers counseling them.</p>
 
        <p class="bottom-p">Like many in the LGBTQ community, Haskell had a complicated relationship with his parents.</p>

        <p class="second-p">First offense, he grew up Catholic.</p>

        <p>“There was a priest who came to our house and counseled my father on his alcoholism and my mother on her plight of having an alcoholic husband,” Haskell recounts, “He tried to seduce me. It didn't happen. He finally said, ‘Get up, go home.’ But he was a closeted gay priest.”</p>

        <p>Haskell called the priest the next day, “I said ‘you and I need to talk.’ And we did.” Despite the topic of counseling the night before, the priest was a few drinks in when he decided to overstep his bounds.</p>

        <p>Haskell left the Catholic Church in college.<p>

        <p>Second offense, his parents were not okay with the immoral sin of homosexuality. He went to therapy in Santa Barbara before coming out to his parents. Finally, at 27, Haskell told them he was gay.</p>

        <audio controls>
          <source src="./assets/haskellclip-gayness.wav" type="audio/wav">
        </audio>

        <p>“I let them know that I'd had a lot of therapy and that I'm fine, that nothing's wrong,” said Haskell, “My life is good, but I want you to know I'm not getting married to a woman. You're not getting grandchildren from me.”</p>

        <p>They were not fine with him.</p>

        <p>“They were never fine. Every time, if I tried to talk about it, they would cry,” said Haskell, “My mother thought ‘I relied on you too much.’ My father was alcoholic – ‘It was me I caused you to.’ So it was all of this angst and upset.”</p>

        <p>In the late 70s, his parents passed away. Haskell reflected on his childhood; there were wonderful times and many painful times.</p>

        <p>After his father passed away, Haskell learned from a priest that his father was gay, and his drinking problem was a guise for his unresolved feelings about his own sexuality. He also learned more about his mom when he visited her in hospice care a week before she passed away.</p>

        <p>“I was sitting in her bedroom and she said, ‘Bill, I'm gonna get married. I want you to invite my hairdresser, Mary Guido. And I want you to have vodka and rye and bourbon and gin and scotch,’” said Haskell, “My mother didn't drink and I said, ‘Mother, who are you gonna marry?’ And she said, that's a problem.”</p>

        <p>He recalled the rest of the moment from her perspective: "I can't marry Barbara Bell because she's married to Henry Bell. I can't marry Sally Ryder because she's married to Barry Ryder. I can't marry Georgia Stone because she's married to Bob Stone.”</p>

        <p>Third offense, his parents were closeted. At that moment, Haskell realized his parents thought the only way they could live as themselves was by being a cover for each other. It was an unspoken deal; they never mentioned it.<p>

        <p>When Haskell returned to San Francisco after visiting his mother, he needed some bereavement support. And soon enough, he started volunteering as a bereavement counselor at Visiting Nurses and Hospice of San Francisco. He worked with women whose husbands were dying and gay men whose partners had contracted GRID, or Gay-Related Immune Disorder, which was later renamed HIV/AIDS.</p>

        <p>“I saw it early on and I got scared really quickly because I saw what was happening and people who were dying,” said Haskell, “But I found the experience of volunteering with Hospice of San Francisco to be very powerful.”</p>

        <p>He made a career change and became the hospice's assistant development director. Within six months of working there, the executive director asked Haskell to help develop the country’s first AIDS hospice care. But, first, they negotiated the lease with the Holy Redeemer Church on Diamond Street in the Castro.</p>

        <p>“I had volunteers who were helping me. I had construction contractors. I had to work with the Catholic Church, and the Diocese of San Francisco, the parishioners of the most Holy Redeemer Catholic Church, “ said Haskell, “We raised funds in the Pacific Heights community, straight primarily, and the gay and lesbian community.”</p>

        <p>After two years and $700,000 raised, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/wellness/1987/12/01/a-final-home-for-aids-patients/a4bac72b-163e-4e3d-b7bd-90fc07516e41/">Coming Home Hospice opened</a> in March 1987. Folks diagnosed with AIDS in the community finally had a place to live during the last stage of their life.</p>

          <source src="./assets/haskellclip-open.wav" type="audio/wav">
        </audio>

        <p>Unfortunately, the stigma of HIV was still prevalent. There was a second phase of putting Coming Home together after the initial opening.</p>

        <p>“We put in an elevator and the construction crew that worked on the elevator shaft building it inside…realized we had people with AIDS living and dying in the building, left burned their clothes and never came back,” said Haskell.</p>

        <p>The fear was high.</p>

        <p>“It wasn't uncommon to see in the Bay Area Reporter, the gay newspaper, 30 people, 50 people dying every week,” said Haskell.</p>

        <audio controls>
          <source src="./assets/haskellclip-press.wav" type="audio/wav">
        </audio>

        <p class="bottom-p">He was scared to death of AIDS, and he was part of the fortunate group that never contracted it. At the time, he already met his partner of 32 years, Bob. They got married in 2018, and Haskell is happy with his life. It took moving to California, a lot of therapy, and overcoming the internalized homophobia he grew up with to get to happiness.</p>

        </figure>

        <p id="third-p">He went through his own recovery process and found a rich life by connecting with other LGBTQ+ seniors in the city. Haskell is retired and continues to work in community spaces. He’s a board member of the San Francisco Village, an organization that helps seniors in San Francisco with local resources and programming. With other members of the SF Village, he’s working on an intergenerational climate action group with some students at the University of San Francisco on relabeling plastics accurately. His passion for this action group is apparent through the faster cadence in his voice.</p>

        <p>Haskell has left California, came back, left again, and came back several times, but he's built a spiritual home to be at peace with himself.</p>

          <source src="./assets/haskellclip-proud.wav" type="audio/wav">
        </audio>

        <p>“I'm enjoying my life immensely,” said Haskell, “And as you age, things change and abilities become disabilities, and yet each moment of life is to be treasured and to be enjoyed and to be valued. And that's what I'm doing.”</p>

        <p>For the younger members of the LGBTQ+ community, he says:</p>

        <p class="bottom-p">“I think being gay is a wonderful experience, but I don't think it's a total identity. I think there's so many other aspects to social life and spiritual life that all includes being gay or all of the rainbow colors options, but I think it's following your truth, finding your path, and then having the bravery to really live it.”</p>
